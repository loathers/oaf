## Clan Commands

ASS currently has a relatively active set of free-use community Dungeons used collaboratively to get people skills. This set of commands are used to dig into the dungeon and provide information to our dungeon runners and dungeon managers.

### /status

When invoked, this command will spawn a quick summary of the active Dread instances. Summary includes turns spent in each zone (formatted as "Forest/Village/Castle") and the number of skills left in [The Machine](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/The_Machine)

### /clan

When invoked, this command will spawn a table that includes a lot of information about the current status of that clan's dungeon. This includes things like the status of NCs (mainly availability, but also the path used to get to the available NC), the projected boss given banishes and the alignment of kills, and the kills remaining. This is effectively a much expanded version of **/status**. The two available clans currently are `cdr1` and `cdr2`.

### /skills

When invoked, this command shows the number of skills each user is owed according to the number of turns they've spent in our Dreadsylvania dungeons. The way our collaborative dungeons work is that all turns spent churning the dungeons translate to owed skills; `oaf` is able to look at the skills acquired by individuals and compare them to total involvement in the ASS dungeons to assess how many skills people are owed. To manage this list, use the **/done** command to take users off (or add them back) when they have completed all their Dreadsylvania skills (or forget to perm one).

### /brains

When invoked, this command will assess the status of various possible users that could (in theory) be available brains for people who want to use [The Machine](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/The_Machine) in a Dread instance to get skills and report back their classes.

### /whitelist

When invoked, this command will add a new user to the whitelist for our Dreadsylvania free-use clans. Note that this command may only be invoked by users with moderator powers in the Discord, to avoid people whitelisting themselves and stealing some of the items from the clan stashes.
